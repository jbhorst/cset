1. We learned Web Development because it is a standard way to create user interfaces across platforms, but then we learned all of the non-standard aspects that we have to look out for. What this tells me about building other platform specific user interfaces is that it’s going to add a lot more work to be done. Something compatible on one platform, may not be compatible on another. So, this may require you to tweak some things in order for it to be compatible.
2. Two examples of CSS Media Queries that use different Media Features would be `@media (max-width: …)` and `@media (hover: hover)…`. The user agent will decide whether to use the rulesets depending on the width for the first one and when the cursor hovers over for the second one. For example, you can set the background to be a certain color if you are on a bigger screen, like a computer, and set it to show a different color when on a smaller screen, like a phone.
3. I think it is better to define Breakpoints using the specific content on my site rather than the standard device sizes because designing different layouts for every specific device size would be tedious. There are way too many different screen sizes nowadays. Fluid layouts are better. They let you set a range of screen widths instead of specific sizes. For example, you can make it so a layout looks good between a range of 400 - 600 pixels.

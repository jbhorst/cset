1. When we learn about how professional developers work on larger projects in a few weeks, I will be mainly looking forward to the actual projects themselves. I’m interested to see what sort of projects we will be working on and also how we will be working on them. I am a little nervous as well about how difficult the projects will be, but hopefully having more time to work on them will ease the stress. I’m also wondering if they will be individual projects of group projects.
2. Event Propagation is the stack of events that are activated in a browser. Bubbling is a phase of event propagation where the event of the nested element bubbles up. An example would be, a paragraph with a click event listener that is nested inside of a div that also has a click event listener. Since the paragraph is nested inside of the div, when you click it, the paragraphs event occurs and bubbles up to the div, activating the divs event as well.
3. Two different event types are the keydown event and the click event. The click event has the detail property which keeps track of how many times the mouse was clicked in the same area. Another property of the click event is the onclick property which can be placed in a HTML tag to activate the function. The keydown event has the key property which gets the keyboard button that was pressed. The keydown event also has the onkeydown property which can be placed inside of an HTML tag to activate the function.

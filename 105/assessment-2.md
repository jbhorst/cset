1. After two weeks in the program, I believe the biggest challenge for me will be trying to remember everything that we go over. I know It’s going to be a lot of new information throw at me all at once, and at a pretty fast pace. So far, I believe I am keeping up fairly well. What I plan to do to overcome this challenge is study more over the weekends or when I have free time and also re-read the chapters of Eloquent JavaScript to better understand everything.
2. The “for” loop is a loop that will repeat something until told not to or until something prevents it from looping. The “while” loop is a loop that activates when a condition allows it to or when something happens to trigger it. The “do while” loop is a loop that will trigger a statement to do something, then activates an expression and will loop back around until told to stop.
3. Solving a problem by writing the solution in pseudocode first will help you better understand how to solve a problem. Writing down the solution In code first doesn’t allow you to understand the step-by-step process it takes to fully understand how to solve the problem because you are basically just showing the answer without all of the creative thinking that went into it solving the problem. If you don’t take the time to understand the process, then you may have problems down the road.

1. How I feel about the pace of the program so far is that it started off at a very fast pace. I was somewhat expecting it to be fast, but I was a little unprepared, I guess you can say. For example, all the reading and having to remember everything, which we jumped right into from the start. However, I believe I am catching up and getting used to what I need to do each week in order to succeed. The amount of work isn’t terrible either. 
2. I think functions are a very useful tool to organize large programs because of how they can group code together to perform a certain task(s). For example, if you wanted a certain task to be executed when something invokes it, you would use a function. That task’s entire code will be grouped together in a local scope. The function is assigned a name and all you need to do is call it in order for it to execute. This makes the code in a large program very organized.
3. Bindings inside of a function are called local scopes and binding outside of a function a called global scopes. The analogy discussed in class compares these two scopes to inside and outside of animal cages at a zoo. A local scope would be like an animal in a cage at a zoo, put inside a function that is only allowed inside the function. Global scopes would be like zoo-keeper outside of the cage, who can go anywhere. If the entire zoo was global, it would be a mess.
